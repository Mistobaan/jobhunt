# JobHunt Demo Script

**Intro (0:00 – 0:25)**
Hi, I’m Mark, and this is JobHunt—your AI command center for tailoring resumes to specific job postings. 

Instead of rewriting bullet points for every application,
 JobHunt orchestrates a trio of specialized agents that think like a company’s ATS,
  a resume coach, 
  and a professional writer. 
  
  The result? 
  A truthful, on-brand resume tuned for the role in minutes.


**Purpose (0:25 – 0:45)**
Hiring teams rely on keyword-driven filters, 
so being “qualified” isn’t enough. 

You have to speak the job’s language. 
JobHunt automates that translation. 
It grades your fit,
 highlights gaps, 
 and generates an updated resume while keeping your original intact. 
 
 All you need is your master resume and the job posting.


**Walkthrough (0:45 – 1:45)**

1. **Control Room** – 
I paste my master resume on the left, 
1. the job posting on the right.
2. 
3. **Start Run** 
– I click “Start tailoring run” and kicks off the job. 
Behind the scenes BullMQ runs the flow, 
but for this demo we’re pulling from cache with a slight delay so you can see each stage in sequence.

**Progress Tracker** 

The ATS Evaluation lights up first.
It delivers an initial score.
Next, the Tailoring Plan agent produces quick wins, 
and then the Professional Writer drafts the adjusted resume. 

**Writer Insights** 

This panel summarizes what changed and what still needs work. 
If there’s more than two notes,
I can expand it to review every bullet.

**Adjusted Resume Toggle**
On the right editor I can flip to “Adjusted Resume” to preview the rewrite. 

It’s the same structure as my original, just aligned with the job description phrasing,
and still 100% truthful.

**Wrap (1:45 – 2:00)**

In under two minutes I have a resume ready to ship, 
and a transparent report of what changed. 

That’s JobHunt,
resume tailoring that feels like a backstage crew working just for you. 

Thanks for watching!
