"overallSummary": "Good alignment for a software engineering internship with solid full‑stack web experience (React/Next.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis) and DevOps exposure (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD). Missing several Microsoft‑specific preferred keywords (C#, Java, C++, Golang, Kotlin; TypeScript React is present but no explicit accessibility; API design/microservices mentioned but little depth; algorithms/DS proof is light). Summary currently targets full‑time employment and not internship eligibility in Mountain View; update to emphasize ongoing degree, remaining term, OOP year, and CS fundamentals.",
