"overallSummary": "Well-aligned for Microsoft SWE Intern with strong full‑stack experience in TypeScript/React and Node, API design, CI/CD, containers, and observable systems. Meets required CS enrollment, remaining term, and 1+ year programming; shows DS&A knowledge and teamwork. Gaps include lack of OOP language like Java/C#/C++/Go, explicit multi-threading/concurrency, and direct Kubernetes/observability metrics details; Microsoft tech stack keywords (C#, Azure) are missing.",
"highPriorityGaps": [
"No explicit experience with C#, Java, C++, Go, or Kotlin (object‑oriented language examples in posting)",
"No explicit multi‑threaded/concurrent programming keyword",
"Kubernetes listed but with limited detail; no container orchestration examples beyond exposure",
"Observability terms (dashboards, alerts, tracing) not explicitly named; only general logging/monitoring",
"No API design examples mentioning microservices explicitly (implied, but make explicit)",
"No Microsoft/Azure ecosystem keywords (Azure, C#/.NET)",
"Back‑end service design mentions queues/caching but not explicit API performance/reliability metrics beyond one example",
"Mountain View location okay, but not availability timeline details beyond graduation; could restate remaining terms more clearly"
