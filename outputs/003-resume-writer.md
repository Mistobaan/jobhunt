Graduation Oct 2026 (remaining terms after internship). Full‑stack developer with 1+ year building TypeScript/React frontends and Node.js/Express services backed by PostgreSQL/Redis. Demonstrated strength in data structures/algorithms, API design, CI/CD, containers/Kubernetes, and performance optimization. Collaborative, growth‑oriented engineer who learns new tools quickly and ships reliable, observable software.\n\nCORE SKILLS\nProgramming: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python\nFrontend: React, Next.js, HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, Astro, shadcn/ui, Zustand, SWR\nBackend/Services: Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Redis, BullMQ (message queues), GraphQL, REST, Socket.io (WebSockets), FastAPI, JWT, OAuth, sessions\nArchitecture: API Design, Microservices, Caching, Database Optimization, Message Queues, System Design\nDevOps/Platform: Docker, Kubernetes, Nginx, GitHub Actions (CI/CD), AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda), DigitalOcean, Vercel, Render, Netlify, Performance Monitoring/Observability\nTesting & Practices: Jest, Object‑Oriented Programming, Data Structures & Algorithms, Code Reviews, Debugging, Clean Code Principles, API Documentation\nAI APIs/Frameworks: OpenAI API, Anthropic API, OpenAI Agents SDK, CrewAI, LangGraph, MCP\n\nPROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE\nVolunteer Full‑Stack Developer — Mokse Educational Services\tSep 2025 – Present\n• Applied engineering principles to design and build an automated data ingestion and standardization workflow, reducing manual processing from hours to minutes.\n• Collaborated with stakeholders to gather requirements and iterate on solution design; practiced code reviews and Git‑based workflows in a team environment.\n• Implemented API endpoints and data pipelines with a focus on reliability and efficiency; incorporated logging/monitoring to support troubleshooting and performance analysis.\n\nHACKATHONS\nPMPanda — Build Your AI Teammate with CodeRabbit & Cline\tSep 2025\n• Designed and delivered an end‑to‑end solution that automated PRD drafting and assumption handling, reducing PM document creation time by ~70%.\n• Collaborated in a cross‑functional team of 3 to plan features, review code, and integrate frontend and backend components under tight deadlines.\n• Followed best practices in Git workflow and code reviews; shipped a cohesive UX with real‑time updates and markdown‑enhanced outputs.\n\nPROJECTS\nLingput — AI‑Powered Language Learning Platform | lingput.dev | github.com/markmdev/lingput\nTechnologies: React/Next.js, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, BullMQ, GitHub Actions, Docker (exposure)\n• Implemented background processing with BullMQ + Redis to offload 30s story generation, improving availability and user experience with real‑time progress updates.\n• Optimized performance with caching (PostgreSQL + Redis), cutting application load time from 600ms to 85ms (‑85.8%).\n• Designed and documented REST/GraphQL APIs; added request/response validation and error handling to improve reliability.\n• Built CI/CD with GitHub Actions (build, lint, test, deploy), reducing deployment time from 25m to 5m (‑80%).\n• Migrated session management from relational DB to Redis, eliminating 1.3s latency during access token refresh and improving authentication reliability at scale.\n\nPersonal Portfolio Website | markmdev.com | github.com/markmdev/personal_website\nTechnologies: Astro, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, HTML, CSS\n• Achieved Lighthouse 100s across Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO with sub‑500ms load times and CLS of 0.017.\n• Applied accessibility practices (semantic HTML, proper landmarks, color contrast) and frontend performance techniques.\n\nEDUCATION\nSouthern New Hampshire University — B.S. in Computer Science\tGPA: 4.0/4.0\nGraduation: Oct 2026\n\nHONORS & ORGANIZATIONS\nPresident’s List (GPA 3.7+) | Coding United Programming Club | National Society of Leadership and Success (NSLS)\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES\n• Open to Microsoft internship based in Mountain View, CA.\n",
"implementation_notes": [
"Retitled objective to target Microsoft Software Engineering Intern (Mountain View) and clarified eligibility (graduation Oct 2026; remaining terms).",
"Reordered sections for internship focus: Education remains prominent and eligibility noted in Summary; Skills grouped and scannable.",
"Added HTML/CSS, REST, WebSockets; consolidated cloud platforms; grouped AI tools under one line to de‑emphasize niche frameworks.",
"Emphasized OOP and DSA in Skills and Summary to address fundamentals; kept truthful to existing practices list.",
"Reframed experiences to highlight engineering principles, API design, reliability, performance, observability, teamwork, and time management.",
"Expanded Lingput bullets to explicitly call out REST/GraphQL API design, CI/CD stages, caching, background jobs (concurrency via queue), and measurable performance outcomes already present.",
"Tied portfolio Lighthouse results to accessibility awareness (semantic HTML, landmarks, contrast) without overstating beyond what’s plausible from Lighthouse/accessibility work.",
"Maintained ATS‑friendly structure, action‑first bullets, consistent tense, and included working links."
],
"unaddressed_items": [
"Could not add concrete experience with C#, Java, Golang, Kotlin, or C++ as none is present in the source resume.",
"Could not claim explicit microservices deployment or API versioning details due to lack of concrete evidence in projects.",
"Could not provide specific observability tooling (dashboards/alerts/tracing like Grafana/Prometheus/CloudWatch) beyond general logging/performance monitoring since tools were not listed.",
"Could not add multi-threaded programming beyond asynchronous/background jobs with queues, as no explicit multi-threading examples exist.",
"Dates (Sep 2025) were retained as provided; no changes made to avoid fabrication."
